Hello my dear future colleagues, I hope everything is great for you.

Unfortunately, I haven't received any messages or advice about our meeting tomorrow.

We met with some of our group mates in our meeting last Friday and we thought it would be a great exercise to practice the interview questions.
Therefore, I prepared a practice plan which is related to our soft-skill class topics and according to sample interview questions which are exist in the canvas.
We will respond all of them in our weekly meetings.
Please watch the recordings that is related with your own questions on the canvas and prepare yourself and your answer before the meeting.
We do not have to answer as if we were in an interview, it is enough if we share what we understand from the answer.
Please make sure that your answers do not exceed two minutes in order to better time managing.

I hope it would help us for gaining some experience.
